== Setup

=== Authentication

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Create an API token
3. Store as secrets/variables in CloudBees:
   - `JIRA_URL`: Your Jira instance URL
   - `JIRA_USERNAME`: Your email address  
   - `JIRA_TOKEN`: Your API token (store as secret)

=== Troubleshooting

**Permission Errors**: Ensure your user can access the project and add comments
**Issue Not Found**: Check the issue key exists and you have permission to view it
**Invalid JQL**: Test your JQL query in Jira's issue search first
